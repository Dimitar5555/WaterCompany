## About the game and other usefull information
### What is the goal of this game?
The goal is to do something a little bit more comlex then a regular incremental game. Here you need to balance water input and output. It's not for like engineering where you have to place each pipe on specific place or you will use 0.00005% more money :D
### That is a good game, but it can do better. I have some suggestions on specific/more general things. Where Can I share them?
We have a [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaterCompany/) and there we have a [suggestions topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaterCompany/comments/6cttiy/suggestions/), where you can tell us your suggestion.
### I have found a bug/visual error/other. Where to report it?
We also have a [topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaterCompany/comments/6cttcl/bugs_and_glitches/) for bugs. Fell free to tell us all the bugs.
